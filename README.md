Ryan Durnan Lab6 Submission

This lab required me to compare elements in a single vector and elements between two lists. 
Two separate functions were created to make said comparisons; both were meant to execute with 
a certain speed.

Jagadish (TA) helped me think through the function finding the most isolated number in a vector.

Jagadish (TA) helped me understand iterators to get me started on the function finding the number 
of elements that the first list did not share with the other.

Included here are two screenshots. The first, simpleOutputs.png, demonstrates that my functions work 
given the small examples in the lab description. The second, output.png, is supposed to show that my functions 
work with the larger examples. The most isolated number function finished executing in a timely manner; however, the 
list comparison function could not execute in linear time the way I built it.
